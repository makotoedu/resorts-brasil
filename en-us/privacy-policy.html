                            agreements and/or any other competent authority. Said processing may include your

                    <h4>Can your personal data be transferred internationally?</h4>

                    <p>Please note that Brazilian laws regarding the protection of Personal Data apply, since Resorts is

                    <p>The transfer of personal data only involves companies that demonstrate compliance with applicable

                    <p>The security of your personal data is one of our main concerns. To protect it, we use technical
                        and organizational information security measures aimed at the confidentiality and protection of
                        all data collected or generated in Our Environments. However, these protections do not apply to
                        information you choose to share in public areas, such as third-party social networks.</p>
                    <p>The transmission of information over the internet is unfortunately not completely secure and,
                        although we do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of data
                        during transmission through our website, especially against attacks perpetrated by malicious
                        persons, that can be highly sophisticated and innovative, with techniques and methods unknown
                        until then even by the best information security tools.</p>
                    <p>The security of your data is also dependent on you taking reasonable steps in your use of your
                        devices and software. If you identify or become aware of something that could compromise the
                        security of your personal data, or any possible vulnerability in our website or systems, please
                        contact us.</p>

                        in the relationship with us and the execution of a specific processing purpose if you wish to
                        revoke your consent;</p>
                    <p><b>Opposition:</b> The right for you to object to the processing of personal data that is

                        example, when the provision of information may reveal a business secret or due to compliance
                        with any legal / regulatory obligation or to allow our defense in any judicial or administrative
                        lawsuit. You can exercise these rights by contacting us via email contato@resortsbrasil.com.br
